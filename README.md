# React Horizontal Calendar

A customizable horizontal scrollable calendar component built in React that allows users to select dates, scroll through weeks, and choose custom button colors. The component uses `dayjs` for date management and includes previous/next week navigation.

## Features

- **Horizontal Scrollable Calendar**: A clean, scrollable week-based calendar.
- **Customizable Colors**: Users can customize the color of the next/previous buttons.
- **Date Selection**: Click on a date to select it.
- **Min Date**: Users are restricted from selecting dates prior to the current date.
- **Previous/Next Week Navigation**: Scroll through weeks easily with the previous and next buttons.

Example
Hereâ€™s a more detailed example of how to use this component in your project:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ScrollableCalendar from 'react-calender-horizontal';

const App = () => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);

  const handleDateChange = (date) => {
    setSelectedDate(date);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Selected Date: {selectedDate ? selectedDate.toString() : "None"}</h1>
      <ScrollableCalendar 
        onDateChange={handleDateChange} 
        buttonColor="#ff5722"  // Custom color
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
Get Deleted Date
To get the date that has been unselected or reset by the user, you can add logic to handle when a previously selected date is clicked again:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ScrollableCalendar from 'react-calender-horizontal';

const App = () => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);

  const handleDateChange = (date) => {
    if (selectedDate && selectedDate.getTime() === date.getTime()) {
      setSelectedDate(null); // Date deselection
      console.log("Date deselected: ", date);
    } else {
      setSelectedDate(date);
      console.log("Selected date: ", date);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Selected Date: {selectedDate ? selectedDate.toString() : "None"}</h1>
      <ScrollableCalendar 
        onDateChange={handleDateChange} 
        buttonColor="#4caf50"  // Custom button color
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
